/**
 * A low-level React hook that creates a `RateLimiter` instance to enforce rate limits on function execution.
 *
 * This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
 * you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).
 *
 * Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach that allows executions until a maximum count is reached within
 * a time window, then blocks all subsequent calls until the window resets. Unlike throttling or debouncing,
 * it does not attempt to space out or collapse executions intelligently.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * For smoother execution patterns:
 * - Use throttling when you want consistent spacing between executions (e.g. UI updates)
 * - Use debouncing when you want to collapse rapid-fire events (e.g. search input)
 * - Use rate limiting only when you need to enforce hard limits (e.g. API rate limits)
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
 * in two ways:
 *
 * **1. Using `rateLimiter.Subscribe` HOC (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**
 *
 * Use the `Subscribe` HOC to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
 * needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
 * in child components.
 *
 * **2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**
 *
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render
 * at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant
 * state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` HOC. This prevents unnecessary
 * re-renders and gives you full control over when your component updates.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `executionTimes`: Array of timestamps when executions occurred for rate limiting calculations
 * - `rejectionCount`: Number of function executions that have been rejected due to rate limiting
 *
 * The hook returns an object containing:
 * - maybeExecute: The rate-limited function that respects the configured limits
 * - getExecutionCount: Returns the number of successful executions
 * - getRejectionCount: Returns the number of rejected executions due to rate limiting
 * - getRemainingInWindow: Returns how many more executions are allowed in the current window
 * - reset: Resets the execution counts and window timing
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const rateLimiter = useRateLimiter(apiCall, {
 *   limit: 5,
 *   window: 60000,
 *   windowType: 'sliding',
 * });
 *
 * // Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe HOC
 * <rateLimiter.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount })}>
 *   {({ rejectionCount }) => (
 *     <div>Rejected: {rejectionCount} requests</div>
 *   )}
 * </rateLimiter.Subscribe>
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution count changes at hook level (optimized for tracking successful executions)
 * const rateLimiter = useRateLimiter(
 *   apiCall,
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 60000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when rejection count changes (optimized for tracking rate limit violations)
 * const rateLimiter = useRateLimiter(
 *   apiCall,
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 60000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({ rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution times change (optimized for window calculations)
 * const rateLimiter = useRateLimiter(
 *   apiCall,
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 60000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({ executionTimes: state.executionTimes })
 * );
 *
 * // Multiple state properties - re-render when any of these change
 * const rateLimiter = useRateLimiter(
 *   apiCall,
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 60000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     executionCount: state.executionCount,
 *     rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Monitor rate limit status
 * const handleClick = () => {
 *   const remaining = rateLimiter.getRemainingInWindow();
 *   if (remaining > 0) {
 *     rateLimiter.maybeExecute(data);
 *   } else {
 *     showRateLimitWarning();
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { executionCount, rejectionCount } = rateLimiter.state;

/**
 * A React hook that creates a rate-limited state value that enforces a hard limit on state updates within a time window.
 * This hook combines React's useState with rate limiting functionality to provide controlled state updates.
 *
 * Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach - it allows all updates until the limit is reached, then blocks
 * subsequent updates until the window resets. Unlike throttling or debouncing, it does not attempt to space out
 * or intelligently collapse updates. This can lead to bursts of rapid updates followed by periods of no updates.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All updates within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows updates as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of updates over time.
 *
 * For smoother update patterns, consider:
 * - useThrottledState: When you want consistent spacing between updates (e.g. UI changes)
 * - useDebouncedState: When you want to collapse rapid updates into a single update (e.g. search input)
 *
 * Rate limiting should primarily be used when you need to enforce strict limits, like API rate limits.
 *
 * The hook returns a tuple containing:
 * - The rate-limited state value
 * - A rate-limited setter function that respects the configured limits
 * - The rateLimiter instance for additional control
 *
 * For more direct control over rate limiting without state management,
 * consider using the lower-level useRateLimiter hook instead.
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management via the underlying rate limiter instance.
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which rate limiter state changes will trigger a re-render,
 * optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
 * full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
 * component re-render when the selected state values change.
 *
 * Available rate limiter state properties:
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `executionTimes`: Array of timestamps when executions occurred for rate limiting calculations
 * - `rejectionCount`: Number of function executions that have been rejected due to rate limiting
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const [value, setValue, rateLimiter] = useRateLimitedState(0, {
 *   limit: 5,
 *   window: 60000,
 *   windowType: 'sliding'
 * });
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution count changes (optimized for tracking successful updates)
 * const [value, setValue, rateLimiter] = useRateLimitedState(
 *   0,
 *   { limit: 5, window: 60000, windowType: 'sliding' },
 *   (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when rejection count changes (optimized for tracking rate limit violations)
 * const [value, setValue, rateLimiter] = useRateLimitedState(
 *   0,
 *   { limit: 5, window: 60000, windowType: 'sliding' },
 *   (state) => ({ rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution times change (optimized for window calculations)
 * const [value, setValue, rateLimiter] = useRateLimitedState(
 *   0,
 *   { limit: 5, window: 60000, windowType: 'sliding' },
 *   (state) => ({ executionTimes: state.executionTimes })
 * );
 *
 * // With rejection callback and fixed window
 * const [value, setValue] = useRateLimitedState(0, {
 *   limit: 3,
 *   window: 5000,
 *   windowType: 'fixed',
 *   onReject: (rateLimiter) => {
 *     alert(`Rate limit reached. Try again in ${rateLimiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Access rateLimiter methods if needed
 * const handleSubmit = () => {
 *   const remaining = rateLimiter.getRemainingInWindow();
 *   if (remaining > 0) {
 *     setValue(newValue);
 *   } else {
 *     showRateLimitWarning();
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Access the selected rate limiter state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { executionCount, rejectionCount } = rateLimiter.state;
 * ```

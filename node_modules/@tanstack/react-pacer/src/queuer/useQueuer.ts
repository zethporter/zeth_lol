/**
 * A React hook that creates and manages a Queuer instance.
 *
 * This is a lower-level hook that provides direct access to the Queuer's functionality without
 * any built-in state management. This allows you to integrate it with any state management solution
 * you prefer (useState, Redux, Zustand, etc.) by utilizing the onItemsChange callback.
 *
 * For a hook with built-in state management, see useQueuedState.
 *
 * The Queuer extends the base Queue to add processing capabilities. Items are processed
 * synchronously in order, with optional delays between processing each item. The queuer includes
 * an internal tick mechanism that can be started and stopped, making it useful as a scheduler.
 * When started, it will process one item per tick, with an optional wait time between ticks.
 *
 * By default uses FIFO (First In First Out) behavior, but can be configured for LIFO
 * (Last In First Out) by specifying 'front' position when adding items.
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
 * in two ways:
 *
 * **1. Using `queuer.Subscribe` HOC (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**
 *
 * Use the `Subscribe` HOC to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
 * needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
 * in child components.
 *
 * **2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**
 *
 * The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render
 * at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant
 * state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` HOC. This prevents unnecessary
 * re-renders and gives you full control over when your component updates.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `executionCount`: Number of items that have been processed by the queuer
 * - `expirationCount`: Number of items that have been removed due to expiration
 * - `isEmpty`: Whether the queuer has no items to process
 * - `isFull`: Whether the queuer has reached its maximum capacity
 * - `isIdle`: Whether the queuer is not currently processing any items
 * - `isRunning`: Whether the queuer is active and will process items automatically
 * - `items`: Array of items currently waiting to be processed
 * - `itemTimestamps`: Timestamps when items were added for expiration tracking
 * - `pendingTick`: Whether the queuer has a pending timeout for processing the next item
 * - `rejectionCount`: Number of items that have been rejected from being added
 * - `size`: Number of items currently in the queue
 * - `status`: Current processing status ('idle' | 'running' | 'stopped')
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const queue = useQueuer(
 *   (item) => console.log('Processing:', item),
 *   { started: true, wait: 1000 }
 * );
 *
 * // Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe HOC
 * <queue.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ size: state.size, isRunning: state.isRunning })}>
 *   {({ size, isRunning }) => (
 *     <div>Queue: {size} items, {isRunning ? 'Processing' : 'Idle'}</div>
 *   )}
 * </queue.Subscribe>
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when queue size changes at hook level (optimized for displaying queue length)
 * const queue = useQueuer(
 *   (item) => console.log('Processing:', item),
 *   { started: true, wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     size: state.size,
 *     isEmpty: state.isEmpty,
 *     isFull: state.isFull
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when processing state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
 * const queue = useQueuer(
 *   (item) => console.log('Processing:', item),
 *   { started: true, wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     isRunning: state.isRunning,
 *     isIdle: state.isIdle,
 *     status: state.status,
 *     pendingTick: state.pendingTick
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for stats display)
 * const queue = useQueuer(
 *   (item) => console.log('Processing:', item),
 *   { started: true, wait: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     executionCount: state.executionCount,
 *     expirationCount: state.expirationCount,
 *     rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Example with custom state management and scheduling
 * const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
 *
 * const queue = useQueuer(
 *   (item) => console.log('Processing:', item),
 *   {
 *     started: true, // Start processing immediately
 *     wait: 1000,    // Process one item every second
 *     onItemsChange: (queue) => setItems(queue.peekAllItems()),
 *     getPriority: (item) => item.priority // Process higher priority items first
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Add items to process - they'll be handled automatically
 * queue.addItem('task1');
 * queue.addItem('task2');
 *
 * // Control the scheduler
 * queue.stop();  // Pause processing
 * queue.start(); // Resume processing
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { size, isRunning, executionCount } = queue.state;
 * ```
